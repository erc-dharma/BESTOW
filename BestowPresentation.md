BESTOW is an acronym. It stands for "Benedictory and Exhortative Stanzas: Thread of Officially uttered Words", a postdoctoral project carried out by Amandine Wattelier-Bricout. Its main objective is to map and study the use and spread of final stanzas cited in grants all over South and Southeast Asia.

The anthology presented below consists of the 164 Sanskrit stanzas that Sircar (1965) identified in his appendix 'Stanzas on Bhūmi-dāna quoted in Raja-śāsanas' and new stanzas that came to light during the course of the project. To make it easier to refer to the stanzas, each one has a unique identifier made up of the letters BEst followed by four numbers (BEst_0000). An identifier BEst0000v00 means that the stanza is a variant of stanza BEst0000, which is a variant mentioned in a note by Sircar (1965) or identified during the project.

For each stanza, the anthology provides:

* a standardised text of the verse
* a translation
* a list of occurrences in epigraphic sources
* a list of occurrences in manuscript sources (*dharmaśāstra*, *purāṇa*, epics, etc.)
* an overview of the secondary literature and information available on that particular stanza.
